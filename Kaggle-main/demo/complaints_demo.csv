1,Vehicle loan or lease,"I contacted Ally on Friday XX/XX/XXXX after falling behind on payments due to being out of work for a short period of time due to an illness. I chated with a representative after logging into my account regarding my opitions to ensure I protect my credit and bring my account current. 

She advised me that before an extenstion could be done, I had to make a payment in the amount of {$270.00}. I reviewed my finances, as I am playing catch up on all my bills and made this payment on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. This rep advised me, once this payment posts to my account to contact Ally back for an extention or to have a payment deffered to the end of my loan. 

With this in mind, I contacted Ally again today and chatted with XXXX. I explained all of the above and the information I was provided when I chatted with the rep last week. She asked several questions and advised me that a one or two month  extension/deffered payment could be done however partial payment is needed! WHAT? She advised me {$230.00} or there abouts would be due within 10 days from me accepting the agreement and then the remaining bal of {$150.00} or there abouts would be due in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, my payments of {$380.00} per month would resume. 

If this was the case, I SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN OFFERED THIS WHEN I JUST MADE MY PAYMENT so that I could catch up on my bills. 

This company was working with XXXX in New Jersey which has since closed most likely due to illegal practices, they changed my loan company to this company after I had signed paperwork for another, kill you with interest rates and has NEVER once considered refiancing my vechile for a lower interest rate ( due to the age of the vechile other companies will not take it ) and THEY DO NOT WORK WITH YOU!",0
12,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Hello This complaint is against the three credit reporting companies. XXXX, Trans Union and XXXX. I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The response from XXXX and XXXX  was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XX/XX/XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. 
I wrote XXXX and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only XXXX wrote back a letter dated XX/XX/2019 stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. 

Trans Union never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019 to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with TransUnion, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. 

Please investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected. No I dont have to fight because XXXX, XXXX and Trans union all lied and said that XXXX verified and account which is impossible because my account with them is FROZEN and no one can access it but I. I demand that these items on my account that was not verified be removed from my account because they are in violation of my rights and not to mention, Trans union did not even respond to my investigation request.",1

33,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","In an attempt to purchase concert tickets, I communicated with an internet seller. He gave his name, email address and phone number and via a phone conversation, explained that he felt more secure using XXXX  through his bank account. He sent a screenshot with a confirmation that tickets had been transferred to my friend with all relevant personal information and pickup information confirmed - it looks legitimate. 

I initiated the transfer through XXXX via my Chase Banking app, presuming that I was protected by Chase Fraud services if the transaction were to go sour. If I was transferring money from within my Chase account, SURELY Chase services would still protect me, right? No ... .I was wrong. I confirmed the transaction and followed the seller 's instructions for ticket pickup, however the tickets were not there as promised, and when I tried to contact the seller, he of course was unresponsive. Nowhere in the XXXX  payment initiation process does it prompt you to confirm that the transfer is NOT protected by the normal Chase fraud protection, again, despite the fact that it is literally embedded in the bank account. It's incredibly, and intentionally, unclear and misleading. The entire point of using this tool was to avoid something like XXXX, which in retrospect, is exactly the same thing.

39,Vehicle loan or lease,"We are writing this letter to dispute a delinquent payment reported for XX/XX/2018 under our GM Financial account. 
Our account was set up for autopay and we were unaware that the autopay had an expiration date. 
According to customer service, the autopay ended XX/XX/2018 so our XX/XX/2018 payment was delinquent. 
We use autopay for many accounts and the autopay is usually continuous for the life of the loan/account. 
We explained to their customer service department that we didnt receive any notices that our autopay was going to be ending soon or that it needed to be renewed. They said that they dont provide these types of notifications because it is the customer who sets up the autopay. 
We also explained to their customer service department that we never received any phone calls that we were past due on any payments. They explained that the collections department tried to contact one of the numbers on file and was told not to call that number again. On further review of the loan application, it appears they reached out to my husbands HR department at work which he placed on the lease application to verify employment. They said that eventhough they didnt try to reach out to our cellphones, they are not required to even call us. The call they made to my husbands HR department was just a courtesy call. 
We would like to file a complaint against GM Financial as we do not feel GM Financial notified us appropriately before reporting a delinquency to the credit agencies. We feel that GM Financial should have either notified us that our autopay would be ending soon or that the autopay had ended. We also feel that GM financial should have called our cellphones not our HR department to reach us.",0

I called XXXX  XXXX XXXX immediately after I was given the news that I was laid off.. I was concern for I was never late and I wonder if there was a program or any type of help that could help out until I found a job and make the new income adjustment work. I will never forget how this day has changed my life. 
I spoke to a customer service to a gentleman by the name of XXXX XXXX was very accommodating. He went on to tell me that there was nothing to worry about because the government had just signed "" bailout money "" for borrowers like me. He mentioned that in order to qualify for 2 % modification all I had to do was to miss three payments. I went home and told my husband and he was very reluctant. I went on and miss the payments. I did not hear anything from the bank for months. Shortly after I received a forbearance letter asking for all the money that I had missed. 
After paying the three payment on trial period the modification disappeared. The two subsequent payments were never found. I applied for a modification again four times. All documentation was sent in. I was denied four times with out an explanation. My marriage ended because all the stress. 
Since XXXX  XXXX XXXX advised me to skip my mortgage payments, they quickly transferred the loan to XXXX and then to Shell point. I feel I was defrauded by my bank. I am also victim of predatory lending. I must comment that XXXX  XXXX XXXX rewarded employees for denying applications and referring customers to foreclosure, according to the statement.

Other rewards included Gift cards retail stores or restaurants, said XXXX and XXXX XXXX.

42,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I was initially contacted by XXXX XXXX in Fall 2016. Equitable Acceptance has partnership with XXXX XXXX/XXXX XXXX. These corporations are scam companies "" dealers '' for Equitable Acceptance. XXXX XXXX XXXX calls individuals and present a con/scam that they can enroll students in a special student loan repayment program. These corporations inform students that they qualify for loan forgiveness program and much lower monthly payments to their lenders ; which would ensure less payment out of student 's pocket and more loan being paid off/forgiven by the government. These corporations inform that the offer is only provided through their enrollment and the program enrollment will be ending soon. These corporations charge a fee for this service, in my case it was {$1800.00} in monthly direct debit amount of {$30.00} from my bank account. But these corporations convince students this is a great deal compared to how much they will save you from paying back to loan lender. Once an individual agrees to enroll in their scam program, they are connected to Equitable Acceptance to set up payment plan for their {$1800.00} document processing fee etc. Unfortunately, I fell for their scam. The documents are actually available FREE on department of education website, that students can complete themselves for no charge. These corporations were submitting false documents on my behalf indicating that my annual income is lower than it actually is. I never qualified for any of the programs that would result in student loans being forgiven. It only ended up costing me {$1800.00} and additional length on my student loan re-pay since they enrolled me in extremely low payback program. I want these evil scammers taking advantage of vulnerable students to stand trial for their crimes and be incarcerated. This scam needs to stop! I don't expect to see my {$1800.00} again as they are a fraudulent ponzi-scheme company. But I don't want them to continue in business getting rich off poor working students and ripping of Department of Education at same time if they continue enrolling individuals in re-payment programs that they don't qualify for.",5

58,Mortgage,"We are experiencing wrongful foreclosure proceedings by Home Point Financial - haven't missed a payment with the exception of an approved forbearance period of 3 months. Funds from a FHA Disaster Partial Claim Modification ( to pay for  forebereance months ) have yet to been applied a year after signing documents. 

After Hurricane Irma ( XX/XX/XXXX ), Home Point Financial ( our mortgage bank ) offered a 3-month forbearance ( for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ). In XX/XX/XXXX, we continued with our monthly payments until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, we submitted paperwork for an approved FHA Disaster Partial Claim modification that would cover payment for forbearance months + XX/XX/XXXX ( while the modification was setup and took place ) in the amount of {$10000.00}. We were instructed to resume payments in XX/XX/XXXX, and we have sent our monthly payment without failure to this date. 

However, as of today XX/XX/XXXX ( a year after we submitted documentation for the FHA Disaster Partial Claim modification ), the funds have not been applied to the account. In the bank system, we appear delinquent to the amount that equals this modification and regardless of our multiple attempts to call attention to the bank to review this anomaly, we have been told that their system is correct and that we must pay in full that amount. 

We sent a letter* dated XX/XX/XXXX to several offices of Home Point in multiple states with copies of all checks proof of our  regular payments. Should the FHA modification funds were applied, we would not be delinquent. We doubt they read our letter. On phone call in XX/XX/XXXX we were told that because of our delinquency our account was sent to legal department to initiate foreclosure proceedings. *letter attached to this claim. 

Checks with mortgage payments for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were returned ; we sent XXXX 's payment but won't be surprised that is also returned. At the moment our delinquency totals 7 months : 4 months covered by the FHA modification + XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. We have placed the funds for the returned checks aside so that when the bank starts accepting payments again, we will be able to submit. 

For months we have received calls from debt collectors, and experienced dismissives from multiple bank associates and managers - because in their records their files are accurate. They don't seem to realize the FHA modification funds are missing! 

We need help locating the FHA modification funds and having them properly accounted towards our account so that we can bring our loan account current, and stop the wrongful foreclosure proceedings.",4

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a shock! The mortgage company neglected to put in the MUD taxes in the note resulting in a $ XX/XX/XXXX increase in payments.

How in the world can that happen. anyway in order not to lose my home, I borrowed the money off my credit card and paid the taxes on the house directly. I then asked the mortgage company to adjust my escrow for this year.

Now they are threatening me with foreclosure. When I sent in my payment of {$1800.00}, they applied it to the escrow without my permission. I have sent the mortgage payment the same way for the past year but in order to continue this unfair tactic, they applied it to escrow. I guess they make a lot of money off interest in escrow.

Learned tonight, after 3 hours waiting for Equifax to answer, I was advised there is an EXTENDED on my Equifax.

Now, apparently id theft has happened with Equifax. Someone submitted documents to Equifax. Now there is someone tampering with my Equifax report and that is identity theft.

I requested copies of the paperwork that was obtained to of made the alert possible.

I was told I am not allowed to have the information. I am completely locked out of my account and not able to monitor.

Equifax, is not working with me ; yet against me. Should not credit bureaus be working with victims of ID theft?

They made it difficult, and after 3 hours back to square one. Phone disconnected and none of my concerns or actions necessary to protect myself are possible.

I am concerned with the way they identified me. They asked questions that anyone could answer. Of course because someone used the info to add the extended.

I asked her to verify my calling me or texting. I feel safer and its a good tool. I was told they are unable to do that.

Equifax is part of the problem and if they dont cooperate ; what can I do? Submit a complaint to CFPB in which they never acknowledge any of my complaints.

Equifax needs to change their policies to ensure there are extra steps of getting a consumer verified other than asking questions, that someone has from ID theft.

The entire waste of time, without any resolution, and still locked out.

How do I get around this which, should not be difficult in the first place and what reasons are they unable to send a code to our phones and we verify.

The only option they offer, is an email to click a link and emails do not always get delivered quick. I was told to wait an hour, I accept that.

Why would they not take extra secure measures to verify my identity? It is already been established ; someone submitted a copy of my social security, proof of address, and other documents they require for an extended. Am I the XX/XX/XXXX consumer who finds many holes in this process that does nothing for protecting and verifying my identity.

Lastly, if you require further information, how do you communicate with the person filing a complaint? Is there a portal or account options so consumers may have access to reports submitted?

( XXXX ) In response to notices received from RTR dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we are requesting that these omissions of RTR having received either Notice of Assignment, Sale or Transfer of servicing rights of the loan to be definitely defined per statutes of Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), the Fair Debt collections Act ( FDCPA ), as well as the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) .RTR was served with a Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and they have failed to properly respond to our demands under RESPA , FDCPA and FCRA. They have failed to indicate and establish proper ownership and rights to service the loan. Furthermore, they have failed to provide an itemized accounting ledger of crediting payments made, late fees, etc. from multiple alleged prior servicers of the loan. The assignments, sale affidavits, allonge ( s ) to the note and loan transfers documentation is incomplete and inconsistent with proper mortgage securities and we feel that we are victims of mortgage securitization fraud on many levels, riddled with an array of abusive deceptive practices and misrepresentation.XXXX of RTR, signed an alleged executed agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) dated XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. By RTR 's own omissions they did not take over servicing rights to the loan until XXXX XXXX, XXXX from XXXX. We have also taken this matter a step further and contacted XXXX County land records here in Texas, and there is no record of assignments for this loan which support or remotely indicate that RTR nor XXXX carry legitimate custodial servicing rights or ownership to this loan. In fact, it appears as though XXXX, still owns the loan which is impossible, because they filed Chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX and all securities liquidated. ( SEE EXHIBIT "" A '' -Collection Agreement Forgery ) According to land records, the loan was originated with XXXX . From there, it was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX was shut down, following XXXX XXXX filing bankruptcy XXXX XXXX, XXXX. So how is it possible that there was any such agreement made with XXXX and RTR? The answer is. it 's not possible.It appears that the agent of RTR, named XXXX XXXX, is in fact a Robo-signer ; since the alleged agreement according to RTR was signed and dated XXXX, XXXX XXXX ; long after the collapse of XXXX. The milestones report that was provided from RTR is dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The report documents a span from XXXX XXXX, XXXX until XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; indicating custodial service rights transfers for XXXX, XXXX, and even XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) .The problem as previously addressed, is that XXXX dissolved in XXXX, XXXX XXXX Chapter XXXX in XXXX, all securities sold off, and XXXX is prohibited from participating in any consumer loan in the capacity of owner servicer or any such activities as of XXXX. As far as we are able to tell, the milestone report has been falsified. ( SEE EXHIBIT "" B '' -- XXXX XXXX ) RTR, has also failed to provide evidence of documentation detailing updated assignments of ownership or necessary proof of their custodial servicing obligations. Furthermore, per RESPA and the FDCPA surrounding mortgage debt validation, we are demanding a complete chain of title as well as the Allonge to the Note, sale affidavits and evidence transfer from XXXX to XXXX and XXXX to XXXX, and finally XXXX to RTR.

SPS statements they mailed to me indicates that I owe XXXX XXXX dollars ( XXXX ) for property taxes, which is not true but they refused to tell me how they derived at that number. There are also charges that show XXXX charges for inspections with no details as to why, especially since I was not in foreclosure. I sent SPS a payment history to show that the billing was incorrect however they refused to stop the Auction of my home scheduled for XX/XX/2019. I filed a Notice of Error on XX/XX/2019 they have ignored the notice, even though they have opened an inquiry for research. They indicated they did not have to stop it because of the RESPA regulations did not apply to Dual Tracking for this incident. The notice of error stated numerous accounting errors by SPS, over charges and other erroneous charges from companies that I do not know that are on the SPS statement of charges sent out by the previous servicer and SPS. 

I also was charged for numerous inspections charges for my home when my home was not in foreclosure. I was charged BPO charges and legal fees when my account was in a current status. I am not sure of what the charges are that are on my account and why, but I asked that SPS give  an accounting to why they continued to charge those incorrect amounts to my mortgage account when I have indicated they were incorrect many times. They are currently ignoring my request. I requested that SPS review my account and make corrections to my interest and my principle, they have refused to this date to do that. 
SPS on XX/XX/XXXX received a QWR they have refused to respond to my request, they indicated they will respond to it after my home is auctioned off which does not make a lot of sense to me. SPS has given erroneous information about the status of my account, I was told by several managers especially one that opened the research to verify the accounting errors on my account that the auction of my home would be postponed until that happened. Of course that was lies. I have requested several call backs from supervisor in the department of the Ombudsman and litigations no one will return the call. I requested that other executives in SPS ( any department ) return the call and address my inquiries and there has been no response, no call back and no evidence that they are willing to allow a workout plan. This has been blatant bullying and harassment from SPS with refusal to discuss with me the status of my account. 

The interest on my account is incorrect because of the erroneous charges therefore the principle is incorrect I have as for a pay-off and settlement which they withdrew which was a breach of the prior agreement in place.

It started last month at the same time on XX/XX/XXXX where I was notified that 5 charges were made in the amount of {$15.00} via XXXX. I contested charges last month and I was told by BOA Credit Card Services ( BOA CC ) that by closing my credit card ( CC ) account then the issue was resolved. They failed to tell me that they would still allow the carryover of charges ( even disputed ones ) to our new CC ( BOA failed to expedite the new CC despite our request and it took approximately one week to get a new CC ). We have numerous automatic charges so it took approximately 2 hours of my time to convert those charges to the new credit card received a week later ( New CC ). A month later the same 5 contested charges appeared on the New CC. We called XXXX  who agreed to block the charges and confirmed that these contested charges were automatically transferred by BOA. Each charge was for XXXX- apparently BOA had done NOTHING to block these charges in XX/XX/XXXX- instead they failed to tell us it was up to us to contact XXXX   to block and instead just transferred the charges despite this being the sole reason our CC was closed in XX/XX/XXXX. Because the New CC number was NOT compromised- there was no reason to do more than to dispute the charges. We contacted BOA as XXXX advised we had to do and explained the situation. As explicitly discussed during the call on XX/XX/2019, the instruction was not to cancel the new number as it had NOT been compromised. We were merely disputing the charges. However, we requested reimbursement of the approximately 80.00 in disputed charges. Our call was elevated to a supervisor named XXXX XXXX in the Rhode Island CC service center who was rude and abusive on the call resulting in escalated conversations. Throughout these conversations I was explicitly clear that I would NOT be closing the New CC and Ms. XXXX confirmed this fact including at the end of the call. Ms XXXX began to raise her voice as I repeatedly asked to ask a question but her demeanor changed rapidly and she because rude and condescending as she continued. Ultimately, I was able to tell her that I dont want to fight her but that we take care of this directly with XXXX and that if I had to then I would eat those monies myself so that this wouldnt be a fraud alert because after all, my new card was never compromised. I advised that I would contact XXXX and that if I had to then I would eat the monies myself so that my New CC remain intact- as the new card was never compromised. Regardless, I was shocked by her behavior and contacted BOA to lodge a complaint into Ms. XXXX temperament and rudeness. Hours later it is abundantly clear that Ms. XXXX went back into the account and closed it. This was clearly in retaliation for the complaint. Further, it appears that she failed to even dispute the charges at the center of this matter. This was clearly in retaliation for my complaint. Further, it appears that she failed to even dispute the charges at the center of this matter.The individual taking the complaint was a good kind agent named XXXX  who advised me that this was actually a billing dispute and not a fraud alert and that she would dispute the charges referenced above. After this was completed, XXXX filed my complaint against Ms. XXXX. Approx. 4 hours later I received a panic call from XXXX. Ms XXXX  had done the unthinkable. She cancelled my New CC despite 1 ). the card itself not being compromised and 2 ). my explicit instruction not to cancel it and affirmation of this instruction by Ms. XXXX. Obviously Ms. XXXX  went ( unauthorized by me ) BACK into my New CC account and cancelled the card. The timing is very suspicious as it occurred shortly after my report of horrific customer service. Further, BOA failed to timely notify us that it had cancelled our New CC- and sitting here today, I do not know : 1 ). why it was closed despite the facts above ; 2 ). effective date of closure ; 3 ). if BOA is honoring our dispute of the XXXX charges ( not apparent in the online information ).

This violates regulatory rules and ethics rules. We did not authorize the closing of the New CC nor did we authorize a disgruntled customer service supervisor the authority to go back into our credit card account and to take action. Please investigated and take action against BOA and Ms. XXXX.",2

I had read near all of the extremely lengthy contract in the past before there was this change. Had I known or had they told me or had the placard up for me to read, I would have opted for another business nearby to do business with. This was explained, but they simply have no interest in my credit, the impact this has caused, or the desire to remove the inquiry that I did not authorize and was not made aware of them doing should I do business with them. I know in the end, it's the consumer 's responsibility to read everything. But, like I had said, I did previously. It should be their responsibility to inform clients of any changes or addendums they make. 
I simply want this inquiry removed. It not only impacted my credit score, but looks bad having done business with this type of company to future creditors.",1

I included a copy of this unknown account being deleted off my XXXX   credit report and a copy certified mail to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Experian concluded that the monthly payment and balance is accurate and verified when I did dispute. Clearly its incorrect because a auto car loan can not have a monthly payment of {$0.00}. They verified that the balance of {$15000.00} is accurate. They also verified that I pay {$8000.00} on this account on XX/XX/XXXX. So if I paid {$8000.00} on this account why is the balance is {$15000.00} when Experian verified that {$20000.00} was written off? Which under FCRA is inaccurate and must be DELETED because the balance and monthly payment is is reporting inaccurately.

135,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is my second complaint in only 1 day against TransUnion. I had 36 mistakes just this year in my file with TransUnion and I called so many times, they regularary hung up on me because they don't care. 

This time is that on XX/XX/XXXX, finally my score went up 69 points because I paid my credit cards. I did not know, being immigrant from XXXX, that in the USA, you should not spend more than 20 % of the amount of your credit cards limit. What's the point - it is so stupid. If you have an emergency, let 's say the dentist, you pay with your credit card, and it was not enough to be in pain because of a tooth, that you need to lose point from your credit score. - Where is the logic. 

In any event, I increased 69 points, but on XX/XX/2019, I lost 79 points for no reason that I can see, I did not spend on credit cards, I did not have a new debts. I called a supervisor in the USA, he did not give me his name, he told me that the reason is that I had two ACCOUNTS, yes two ACCOUNTS and they were merged and my score decreased of 79 points. I was fuming, how it is possible to have two accounts, it's not a bank account, it's my credit score linked with what? my Social Security Number. And as everyone else I have only one SSN.

He told me that, of course, there's nothing else to do and he put an end at the conversation and hung up.

If it's the case, that means that TransUnion only as Reporting Agency merged my XXXX Social Security Number with the USA ones. This is not acceptable, both countries has different laws and Credit Bureaus in XXXX are not important at all, certainly not like in the USA. By law in XXXX, our SSN can not be disclose easily, so if TransUnion used my SSN from XXXX, they are in an illegal position with XXXX. There's always a disclosure in XXXX on that card saying that this number and card belong exclusively to the Government. In any event, XXXX and USA are two different countries and totally two different court systems and different laws. Again it is only TransUnion who does that kind of thing, always trying to destyroy someone aggressively, but always pretending to report only.",1

I spoke with a Financial Counselor representative at the bank that asked how did I come to have such a large check. I explained about the settlement. I only wanted to put that money in my personal checking account. I was told that I needed to open a savings overdraft protection account to avoid monthly fees and charges. I believed that was a separate account. This money was never deposited or linked to the overdraft savings account. Both accounts were online banking accounts of which I did not have access to a computer ; therefore, I was unable to check the accounts. No paper statements were sent to me. On XXXX XXXX, a withdrawal made in a Branch/store of {$36000.00} was made. I did not withdraw this money. On XXXX XXXX, a withdrawal made in a Branch/store of {$75000.00} was made.

She asked what account? I told her it was in my overdraft account. She said, What money in an overdraft account? I told her I put money in an overdraft saving account in XXXX. She said that their bank records do not go back that far, their retention period is only 7 years. However, she began to find and printed out an access fifty checking bank statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX. It verified a check totaling {$130000.00} was deposited on XXXX XXXX.

The bank manager found several other accounts in my name of which I never opened or even knew about. I requested to see a signature page or signature of the withdrawal slip for those withdrawals. The bank manager said that information was not available since they only keep 7 years worth of information. I requested an investigation. She notified an escalation team of Wells Fargo. This team called me back in 5 days- they stated the retention policy was only 7 years and she could only find a bank statement starting with XX/XX/XXXX and no further information was available. I believe since the money can not be found or accounted for -identity theft, multiple accounts and a merger between Wachovia and Wells Fargo and Overdraft Protection Account, hid the removal of these monies.",7

174,Checking or savings account,"Dear Sir/Madam, On XX/XX/2018, I deposited a check number XXXX drawn on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX valuing {$4000.00} in my Chase checking account number ending in XXXX. I used Chase Bank ATM located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NY. The check was accepted and I was informed that the funds will be available in my account on XX/XX/2018. I reside in XXXX, XXXX and had a scheduled flight from NY to XXXX. I returned to XXXX on XX/XX/2018. Later, I found that the check was not accepted due to ATM/deposit Error. In an effort to resolve the issue, I contacted Chase Bank via phone multiple times. The call center representatives came up with contradictory information every time. The details of my telephonic correspondence with chase is presented in an attached table. 

Finally, I traveled to New York on XX/XX/2018 to resolve this problem. I visited Chase Bank branch in the XXXX and personally met a banker on XX/XX/2018 to get a clearer picture. Even the banker in the branch was unable to help me and was astonished that they are unable to trace the original check. They suggested sending a copy of the check to the address of the party who wrote the check ( address was printed on the check ). I was informed that I shall have to wait 8-days for the check to be delivered to that address in NY. According to the banker, I must have received the copy of the check and updates about the problem much earlier. But even after the passage of around 3-weeks, the fate of this transaction in unknown. 

This ATM error and further mismanagement due to false and contradictory information presented by Chase Bank call centers has caused me a lot of mental and financial distress. I had to put my payments on hold resulting in accrued late payment fines from the creditors as well as loss of trust. It will also negatively impact my credit score. I had to travel to NY at the recommendation of the Chase Call Center representatives and the banker in the Chase Branch. And I am adding to my costs by staying in NY and waiting to receive updates from Chase. I request that either the check be returned to me promptly, or the amount be deposited in my account immediately. Further, I demand Chase Bank to compensate me for the financial and mental distress caused by their mishandling of the transaction as well as reimburse me for my stay in NY and travel between New York and XXXX. 

Thank you for your kind considerations.",7

176,Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2019 I received an email from PNC Bank XXXX my mortgage servicer ) stating that my automatic payment of my mortgage was processed, however I noted the amount was double that of my mortgage payment. I verified with my checking account that two payments were removed on XX/XX/2019. One of which was the authorized mortgage amount of {$2000.00}. A second, unauthorized payment was also processed from my bank account in the amount of {$2000.00}. 
I then attempted to login to my online banking account and was found that I was locked out of my online banking portal with PNC bank. Therefore I could not verify my loan payments having been made and received. 
I then called PNC bank and spoke with a customer service rep ( XXXX ), he alerted me that PNC was aware of the situation and I had two courses of action, 1. receive a mailed check in the amount of my duplicate payment, this check would take 10-14 days via mail. 2. I could go through the verified process to receive a wire transfer in the amount of the duplicate payment. I told him that I could not wait 10 days to receive my funds back and that this was an unauthorized payment made to PNC that they needed to fix this problem. He alerted me that my only other course of action would be to call my personal bank and stop payment on the second unauthorized amount. 
I then called my personal bank, they told me the funds could not be stopped on their end but they were still pending and there was no reason PNC bank could not cancel the transaction in order for my funds to not be taken out of my account. 
- I called PNC bank back, I spoke with XXXX who gave me the same 2 courses of action as I was originally told. When I asked him to simply cancel the second unauthorized payment he told me that PNC bank does not cancel payments ... .. I escalated to his supervisor ( XXXX ) she verified that PNC bank would not cancel the payment on their end, she alerted me that "" upper management '' is aware of the situation, she did not know how they would return my funds or when I would receive them but I was to trust her in knowing that they are working on it and my funds would be returned. I asked how they would correspond with me going forward, and she said they would not initiate any communication, I would need to call back to find out more information about my funds. Meanwhile, PNC bank has {$2000.00} of my money that I did not authorize them to take from my account and I have no repercussions in knowing when they will be returned to me, if I will have my funds to pay the rest of my bills for the month and feed my family and I am left with no answers as to when or how my money that they took from me will be returned.",4

Wells Fargo is my mortgage lender from XXXX, and I asked them for a mortgage assistance. They offered several options but asked for permission to check my credit score. At this moment the score was about XXXX. However, Wells Fargo asked XXXX XXXX for assistance, and when results came, it was a very unpleasant surprise. The new FICO score has dropped for 83 points - due to the Wells Fargo/XXXX XXXX inquiry. When asked for information why it has happened, the answer was that this score is based upon XXXX  report. I called XXXX and they denied providing such a wrong information. At this moment am disputing this sudden drop of the score and I am asking removal of such inquiry. 
As far as I know, the official credit bureaus are the only providers of credit information. Many new providers of scores are doing it for less money and are increasing the market. Their information is not always correct. They maybe are pleasing the lenders who are paying for information, but it can create harm to customers - intentionally or inadvertently. 
I am informing CFPB because this has happened under your watch of the compliance with FDCPA.",1

I signed the documents from your company and I gave my correct bank account number and debit card number as well or the payment to XXXX XXXX would have never have gone through. On XX/XX/2018 I came into a large sum of money and called your company to ask for a payoff amount which I paid in full. Since that time your company and I have been in a dispute with you telling me that I owe you XXXX. You have reported a false report to the credit bureau that borders on fraud. Yesterday in a final attempt this matter your company and my bank had a three way conversation in which my bank told you that if you had submitted a charge of XXXX it would have been paid. Your response to me was that the payment of XXXX was kicked back to you due to a wrong bank account number or debit card. My bank confirmed that all the information that was on the application was true and correct. So if the payment did not go through it was an error on your part not mine but yet you still argued with my bank. You offered to take this fraudulent amount of XXXX off of my credit report if I paid you that sum. I checked my account with XXXX  and you had yet again altered information fraudulently as of XX/XX/2018 because I checked my credit report after speaking with you. Your company needs to remove all of the fraudulent information you put on my credit report because it seems to me that you are using the misinformation you gave to the credit bureau as ransom just to get me to pay a debt that is not mine!!!,6

191,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Regions Bank account # XXXX. I received a notice from Regions bank stating that this account was pas due. I knew I didn't have an open account with Regions so I cent a certified letter to them which they received asking for information on the account because i didn't have an account with them. I never received anything further from Regions. I received an alert from a credit monitioring site stating that an account on my credit was just marke as 30 days late. I called Regions and they told me that I had a Streamline account and that the yearly fee had been assesed. I informed Regions that I no longer had a Streamline account with them and this account was closed months prior if not a year. I don't even have a checking/savings/or loan account with Regions anymore so I asked her how was it possible to have a fee assessed on a closed account. This streamline account was one that I was approved for {$500.00} that I could barrow money from the account and make monthly payments until the barrowed amount was paid back. Regions closed this account long before I left the bank totally. The account was in good standing and had been closed and updated on my credit file for several months to a year. I do not understand how this bank could charge a {$25.00} fee on a closed account that they closed and how could they add a 30 day late to an account that was closed but in good standings. How would I pay a yearly fee on an account that was closed, one that I didn't even have access to because it was closed and I don't bank with Regions since XX/XX/XXXX. The person I spoke with at Regions bank on XX/XX/XXXX stated the account wasn't properly closed which I don't understand wither because it was closed long before this happened and it showed on my credit report which I can provide to show that it was closed. I then proceded to ask the lady from Regions ok, clearly this was a mistake on REgions part so how do I rectify this incorrect information on my credit report that you all reported and she told me that she could send a note to her lead but this was something that I would have to take care of by disputing with the credit bureaus. Why could it be so easy to report incorrect information but not go back to update the credit bureaus with the correct information? This account was never late as it had been closed and in good standing. She removed the charges fromt the closed account said that she believed it wasn't properly closed which I don't believe is true because I showed on the Regions account that it was closed and it showe on the credit report that it was closed. Waking up to a 51 point drop in a credit score because of a mistake by Regions is not fair and then the Regions rep acted as if she didn't care. I have disputed this with XXXX  and XXXX and it's not on XXXX  and the account is as it should be on XXXX ( in good standings ). I have attached Pictures from my credit report to show that this account was closed as Regions closed it OVER a year ago. They late was added the end of XX/XX/XXXX or first of XX/XX/XXXX",1

For a number of reasons I believe this determination is unjust and inappropriate for my current financial situation and the current guidelines in place by XXXX XXXX to remove a cosigner. No where in the application does it state that I must have a certain dollar amount of income yearly to be approved for the cosigner to be removed, even with that being said I make a very decent amount of income for my age and debt- very easily making monthly payments. According the cosigner release form the guidelines to be met are of the following : I must complete the entire application, which I did. I must meet the age requirement of 18, which I have. Provide graduation completion documentation, which I did. Be a US Citizen, which I am and forever will be. Provide proof of income, I provided my recent pay stub along with my W2- with a very reasonable income. Be current on my service loans and with in the past 12 months, which I have been in repayment for over a year now and have never missed a payment. The next is demonstrated a satisfactory payment history for the last 12 months. And finally no student loans in hardship or forbearance, which I have never had. They did state they would run a credit report the support the fact that I will be able to assume full responsibility for repayment of loans and to make sure there are no signs of bankruptcy, open foreclosure, student loan default or delinquencies.

339,Student loan,"I have had a loan with a principal balance of {$64000.00} since 2013. It is now over {$70000.00} due to accrued interest. Interest has been a nightmare for me and I am sure plenty of other students. I was tipped early on to pay attention to interest and pay it down while in school, and I did so. I even paid some of the smaller school loans off in full before my loan went into effect in 2013. From the get-go, I have always been on an income based plan. At that time, there was no way I could afford rent, utilities, daycare, etc. along with a $ 700+ school loan payment each month. When I was first applying for the income based plan, I spoke to a representative about it in general. He explained to me that the payments are lowered but only low enough to cover interest. As such, I was always under the impression that the payments were only as low as the interest that accrues each month. Otherwise, what's the point? I do not like to let interest accrue. I do not want to risk having any accrued interest capitalized. I would not have agreed to this if I knew better. I feel I was misguided. Anyway, I started the plan. I set myself up for automatic payments. I went on with life until I felt I could start paying down my loan. After some time, I noticed the balance on my loan jumped from XXXX to over 70k. How did my balance increase after I have been making payments on it regularly? I called to question it and learned that it is due to {$6000.00} of accrued interest! My payments are less than the amount of interest accrued each month, so it has been racking up without my knowing. Who knows if it has even been capitalized. I keep trying to find documentation to figure out so, but I can't find anything to help me much. The rep says it isn't capitalized. So here I am ... ready to try to tackle some of my principal, and I can't, because I have a ton of accrued interest to work on before I can even touch principal. I feel helpless. What's the point of having an income based or other plan when you are struggling financially? All you are doing is paying and/or accruing interest ... never touching your principal. I thought the income based plan lowered payments yet still applied to a portion of principal and interest in a pro-rated fashion to what the regular payment amount would be. This is not helping us!",8

I was not satisfied as the rate of 5 percent increased to 8.5 percent. Once I challenged the rate increased her behavior became very aggressive thus making me become very assertive. She would not provide any details around the rate reduction programs and declined to provide any feedback around the changes to the program, noting this she does not have to disclose that information to me. I feel Navient/Sallie Mae takes advantage of their clients. As a result my payment has increased from {$430.00} to {$530.00}. This is absurd and I don't know how to combat this.

I have reached out to these companies on several occasions and they are still contacting me and still showing up on my credit report. These are not my accounts. I have also mailed in or faxed my police report.

I was told that being in forbearance wouldn't hurt, as it is a type of repayment plan multiple times then and until XX/XX/XXXX. 

My loan was transferred to Navient when Sallie Mae was defunct. I called them when I was transferred, and they assured me that utilizing income sensitive repayment options and/or the lowest payment amount, which at times was XXXX $ a month in forbearance, was fine for the PSLF program. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, after re-applying for income sensitive repayment again, I called again, and indicated that I could afford some payment and did not need a full forbearance, and they told me that I qualified for forbearance, and so that is the best thing for me to do. I asked what would happen if I sent payments anyways, and they said, basically nothing, because the balance and interest was so high that sending XXXX-XXXX $ a month wouldn't do any good, and wouldn't change my plan. At that time I was first told that I was not in a program that would qualify me for the PSLF program, and that in order to qualify for that program, I would have to re-consolidate my loans and have my husband co-sign them. She indicated that she was only telling me this because now she was "" legally obligated to do so. '' She indicated that once I reconsolidated I could get into the right program but it would be 10 more years before I qualify, and as it has been 2 decades since my first set of loans, she didn't recommend it as I would be at the 30 year mark anyways. 

I have worked for public agencies with lower pay than public agencies, in public service, since XX/XX/XXXX. I have no idea how many "" qualifying payments '' were made, as often the forbearance was the only option given to me. I suspect that I made roughly 6 years of payments in plans that don't qualify me for the program, and my debt is now over 200,000 $ and my interest rate remains over 6 %. I have been unable to get any clear information about what plans do qualify for the program, and any information from Navient. I don't understand why my husband would have to co-sign my student loans in order for me to qualify for a program that I should already qualify for due to my years of public service.

It concerns me that people at this level of employment have access to this detailed information. In today 's society with security breaches that seek to steal peoples personal information and the ramification of these known issues gravely concerns me that Navient would open themselves and their customers to such a large liability. The amount of customer service representatives that have access to this information not only nationwide but globally is extremely concerning. I hope my concern gives rise to the potential damage to the more than 12 million debtors that Navient currently services.

I paid {$1.00} for what I thought was a 7-day trial so that I could see my credit score a single time.

I went through my bank statements just to make sure and yes, I had made every single payment, there just was not one listed for XX/XX/XXXX because I made it on XX/XX/2019. I emailed the company on their website listing dates and amounts that were paid ( I have attached a copy of the email and their response ) The XX/XX/XXXX payment was made on XX/XX/2019 for the payment amount of {$490.00}. The payment I tried to make early for XX/XX/XXXX was paid on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$560.00}. I paid extra to pay down late fees that I have incurred. Imagine my surprise when in the response from the bank, they told me that they did not show me making a payment of {$490.00} on XX/XX/2019. She asked me to fax the information over if I had proof otherwise which I did on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX, I am attaching the fax confirmation sheet. On Friday, XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from the bank dated XX/XX/2019 stating that they will investigate and let me know what they find.

My credit report shows that I did not make a payment for XX/XX/XXXX, which is false, I sent them a statement from every month showing all of the payments I made. I also had a problem with my mortgage insurance and had to get new. My new company sent them the information in XX/XX/2019 to have insurance begin XX/XX/2019 and to be put in escrow. The company did not pay the bill for the escrow and beginning XX/XX/2019 raised my payment to include their insurance. My payment went from {$490.00} a month to {$780.00}. They would not accept payment for the mortgage only and did not pay the escrow for that. So I went back to the insurance agency and did a new policy that began in XX/XX/2019 but I still had to pay the outrageous amount of {$800.00} because they still did not pay the escrow and I had bounced a check so I added the {$20.00} to that payment, which I told the girl when I called that is what it was for, and yet it still shows I owe a {$20.00} NSF fee which I have attached a copy of my online account because it also STILL shows I owe for XX/XX/XXXX and now XX/XX/XXXX. As of today, XX/XX/2019, they have not paid my insurance to escrow and it will be cancelled on XX/XX/2019 if they do not. I have gone back and forth with this company and they are never willing to help even when it is their fault. I can't afford to pay XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and so I will be going into default soon.

I was told by the landlord that it would get taken care of immediately. It never get taken care of, as a result, the electric bill for one month alone was over {$1000.00} due to these faulty issues. The landlord was supposed to pay this bill, since it was his fault. However, instead this was charged to me. I was not informed this would affect my credit, but since I could not get any hep from the landlord, I did my best to pay this debt anyway. I never received any notice that this would be transferred to collections. However, when collections did call me earlier this year, I still attempted to settle the debt by getting on a payment plan for the sake of my credit. They told me that this would not be reported negatively on my credit report if I began a payment plan. So I proceeded. I have discovered that that they STILL reported negatively on my credit report, and this is hurting me terribly. All this for a debt I do not even owe. I can not get any help on this matter from the company collecting the debt currently listed on my credit report CREDIT MANAGEMENT LP. I also could not get help from XXXX XXXX XXXX who initially charged me such an outrageous bill from a faulty home that the landlord was supposed to repair. I was never even notified in writing about the outstanding balance or that it would be sent to collections. I spite of all this, I am still on the payment plan and am working to pay off this debt I should not owe as agreed when promised it would not affect my credit report if I took action.

I told the loan officer if they could match the lower rate that came through with another lender I would refinance with Supreme. After a day, he confirmed I would get the lower rate ( though he did not mention I had to buy down to that rate until a later time ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the loan officer emailed saying we didnt get approval not to do an appraisal. This was the first time it was mentioned no appraisal would require an approval. In that email, he also told me we would get the fee waived and if not hed make up for it. I paid {$720.00} for an appraisal that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the loan officer told me to make up for the issues with no waiver my first payment would be pushed to XXXX instead of XXXX. He explained this would happen via a refund check through over payment of my old mortgage. 

I closed on XX/XX/XXXX and he assured me that morning prior to signing that Id receive a refund check covering my first full payment long before my due date in XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had no check and emailed asking the loan XXXX the status of my refund check since I received notice Supreme had already sold my mortgage. He called and stated I needed to wait until 3 full weeks from funding had passed and that would be XX/XX/XXXX. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX I still had no check. I emailed again. He told me he was out of office but looking into it the next day when he returned. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, he called to say he was escalating it and would update me the next day. On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed asking for an update since I had not heard any update. I received no response and emailed again on XX/XX/XXXX letting him know I would be reporting and escalating the issue myself if not resolved before the XX/XX/XXXX holiday. 

After all the communication of the past two months ensuring me things would be handled, the loan officer then told me on XX/XX/XXXX, the day my first payment was due, that Supreme had to pay more for my old mortgage because the former mortgage company increased the pay off amount and there was no overage to provide me a refund That was not true as they actually decreased the pay off amount originally provided and confirmed that when I called them on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I emailed the loan officer the exact summary above on XX/XX/XXXX. He replied that he'd forward my email to the "" powers that be '' and has not provided any update. He has called but left no voicemail. He emailed to say to call him but provided no details. I informed him he could provide an update via email. He has not done so.

I have issued verbal and written statements that they are not allowed to call me again, that the debt was paid, and that they have received proof of payment. They have acknowledged all of this, yet they continue to call, sometimes multiple times a day, and harass me at home and at school. They have used intimidation tactics, such as saying if I do not pay the debt in full they will destroy my credit. They have talked to my father, invading my privacy and causing emotional and social stress. They have not, as they said they would, sent me proof that the debt is owed. It has been more than 30 days. They are being fraudulent and negligent. They have reported it, falsely, and it is impacting my credit negatively and harming my ability to take out loans to pay for college and get an apartment.",6

432,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Good afternoon, This has been an ongoing battle between XXXX  and Equifax and the student loans servicer XXXX and how the final outcome of my loans are now being handled. Although my loans were in collections for quite some time due to the fact that my health continues to keep me from entering the workforce. Finally the best opportunity to take care of my outstanding students and I had acted accordingly. To me this process was cut and dry, routinely pay the monthly bill until the loan is in good standing and then do whatever I needed to do to make these loans "" paid in full ''. What I thought was going to be a very simple process ended up being the most frustrating and ludicrous endeavor but not because of anything I was doing. Once the loans were starting to get paid down I was seeing all types of alerts from XXXX  and Equifax. Account monthly payment made. While this process carried on monthly I was seeing other updates and alerts. One was account no longer current or accounts 60 days current now deragatory. I was in routine contact with XXXX and was told that nothing should be happening! We have not released any information on these loans yet! I was told to contact the original loan provider and ask what is going on and I was told that this is the process but once everything is final all this deragatory information will be irrelevant! No, that is not how things were transpiring or were supposed to transpire and I was caught in the middle of all this watching my credit score fluctuating weekly by hundreds of points. These agencies have reported all types of inaccurate information that I have to keep mounting disputes over. Of the 33 records on file in regards to my student loans there's a hodgepodge of different types of scenarios. Seven of the thirty-three records are being reported as outright charge offs! They are basically reporting that they have been unable to recover these accounts when in fact they are just normal transfers! I make every attempt to bring this to the credit reporting agencies to dispute these deragatory charge offs and they refuse to dispute them. They tell me to contact original lender. After speaking to XXXX XXXX and getting nowhere I again contact the reporting agencies and they tell me that I have to take this up with the original lender. So while this is going on a huge portion of my XXXX check over six months to secure the fact that all my student loans were getting at least the bare minimum each month so they all will be in good standing before executing the pay offs.I was already told by an individual at the XXXX  XXXX that if the money was not applied properly than there's nothing that can be done about a loan getting the monthly payment. They have a word for that, it's called theft! 
The last situation that has now sent my credit score back to the basement is a student loan that had a different label attached to it unlike the others. This loan has XXXX University in the title and is now back again on my credit report sending it down to the bottom of this bottomless pit! This loan also was paid routinely every month until it was in good standing and then paid in full! There's nothing else deragatory on my credit reports. This isn't that complicated and I am tired of XXXX  and Equifax not reporting my information correctly. This XXXX University account has been disputed three times now and in a week or so it's back and every time it comes back it destroys my credit worth that much more!",1

It directs me to the TransUnion website, which I must register with to obtain any information. What was not disclosed was registration to the TransUnion website automatically sucks {$27.00} out of your checking account and signs you up at monthly membership rates. What I thought was going to give me a free copy of my credit report was a deception. The subscription fees may have been hidden in the fine print in the link at the bottom of the registration page, I certainly never found it.

This next banker informed me that I would not be receiving a provisional credit after 10 business days of an investigation since provisional credits are only for credit card or debit card transactions. I read to her the Regulation E guidelines and the information from the U.S. Bank Digital Services agreement, which contradicted her statement. Then, she stated that I should go into a physical branch, and they would be able to provide me with this provisional credit. I reemphasized to her that the reason I mailed the check is because I am in a state without a U.S. Bank. Then, she stated that they had just opened a branch that is a three-hour drive away from my city. I informed her that I did not have a car, and I was not going to drive that amount of time even if I did. Then, she suggested that I call the Bank-By-Mail branch to have them issue the credit. When I told her that there is no phone number for this address, she then discovered that this bank-by-mail location can not be contacted by phone number. Then, she informed me that she would file a new investigation that if I agreed to, I would not receive a provisional credit and it would take somewhere between 30 - 90 days. I declined this since this has been going on for months, and I asked her to escalate this situation.

She could not do so and stated that she could not help anyway else, so I immediately contacted the ACH department again. This banker stated that XXXX manager had contacted the XXXX yesterday, and the CCU should be calling me by Wednesday. They also stated that the previous banker 's recommendations would be a waste of my time, and that the previous bankers are trying to "" give me the run around so they don't have to do anything. '' I informed her that I have been repeatedly told that I will be followed-up with but they are unable to do so at any point, so I requested their phone number for when they do not call. She could not provide this. This is absolutely ridiculous that I have spent hours over months requesting that U.S. Bank deposits a {$190.00} check when 1 ) I have a picture of the check and 2 ) their Bank-by-Mail service caused this error as they deposited it into an account that is not mine.",7
467,Vehicle loan or lease,"I have been harassed via phone by XXXX XXXX with Avid Acceptance about a previous loan I had with his company. XXXX XXXX I fell victim to a flood and my car that was financed through this company was deemed a total loss. My apartment and all of my family 's contents were destroyed. My insurance company did not pay the full value of the car nor did I have Gap insurance as I was told I had. I never thought to check the information but found out the hard way after my car was totaled out. Insurance then pushed me to get a new vehicle or be without a car or get a rental at my own expense. I spoke with the Avid Acceptance whom told me they would not finance me until my current loan was paid off. I had to go through another company to get a car for my family, clothes, place to live etc. XXXX has been calling my boss stating that I gave her as a personal reference apparently she gets so many calls she begged me to call him, and tell him to stop calling her. I was not made aware that I could make this complaint or even if something will be done about it. I just need him to stop calling my boss. I have tried to negotiate to get this debt taken care of but what I can afford and what they want me to pay are two different things. I can not even get on the website to make some kind of payment because he says he can not agree with it.",0
468,Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX XXXX, was my mortgage company. They sold my mortgage to another company. The company was the servicer of the mortgage for almost 4 years. XXXX XXXX had the mortgage. The transfer of the mortgage was never recorded in XXXX XXXX records. Then, in XXXX Aurora loan services recorded an assignment of mortgage from XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX to XXXX. The assignment was supposedly executed in XXXX and the XXXX companies involved did not have the mortgage. The documents were never recorded in XXXX XXXX records until another mortgage company by the name of Aurora loan services bought the mortgage. Since it is supposed to be recorded in XXXX XXXX records within a certain amount of time in relation to the closing date, I feel these companies have acted fraudulently. The assignment of mortgage was allegedly signed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX. The assignment was not recorded in XXXX XXXX records of XXXX until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Where did this document sit for all that time? This document supposedly sat in limbo and then mysteriously appeared in XXXX, when Aurora loan services bought the loan. I feel there has been fraudulent activity and do not feel that the assignment of mortgage that was recorded is valid or legal. I would also like to add that XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX are XXXX separate entities. So XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX would not have had the legal authority to assign my mortgage to XXXX and why would the recorded document be returned to Aurora Loan Services and not XXXX?",4

472,Student loan,"I have numerous complaints about my loan servicing company, Navient, and was only allowed to select one issue on the previous page. I can enumerate all of the issues below : Initially, I have always been a public servant when repaying my student loans, and have always attempted to be qualified for the public service loan forgiveness program.

1. I was given completely incorrect information regarding payment plans, payment amounts, and was not provided the right information regarding the lowest payment possible. For the first several years ( XXXX ) I was not making the lowest payment possible. I found out many years later that I could have qualified for payments under {$100.00} a month, but was paying 2 or 3 times that amount at any point.

2. I took out a mortgage on my home to pay down my balances. I made it VERY clear that I wanted the payment to go towards the principal balance. Yet, Navient ( around XX/XX/XXXX ) repeatedly applied the balance to future payments. For nearly 3 months I repeatedly called Navient to have them apply the balance to the principal. I am still unsure if they charged me interest on the larger principal balance during that time. 

3. I was told in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX that I did not have to certify my student loans for PSLF until I had made 120 payments, and that Navient was keeping track of those payments. However, I recently found that many of my coworkers certify their employment on an annual basis, and that their loans are held by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I attempted, once a month, for the last 18 months ( XX/XX/XXXX to present day ) to get information from Navient regarding any PSLF certification paperwork. They REPEATEDLY told me they would send me information via email or mail, and I would never receive this paperwork. Finally, I went online and did a search on my own. I have attempted to get documentation regarding my numerous phone calls and was told they do not email others. Further, I was told that they do not keep any log of calls made by borrowers.",8
